# Federation Architecture Patterns (FAPs)
A **Federation Architecture Pattern (FAP)** is a **modular, reusable blueprint** that provides ready-made templates for building collaborative digital ecosystems.  
At the core of FACIS are **Federation Architecture Patterns (FAPs)** – reusable, pre-defined technical blueprints.  
These patterns provide structured templates for designing interoperable digital ecosystems.  
With FAPs, companies can integrate diverse IT systems, cloud services, and data-sharing platforms **without losing autonomy**.  
By offering modular, open-source designs, FAPs simplify federation-building, lower integration costs, and accelerate adoption across industries.  

- **The Problem:** Every vendor and company uses different technologies, standards, and infrastructures. Connecting them securely and efficiently is often costly and complex.  
- **The Solution:** FAPs deliver **pre-built, open-source technical patterns** that act like **construction plans** for your digital infrastructure. They help integrate different systems seamlessly, reducing complexity and ensuring interoperability from the start.  
- **Benefits for Industry:**  
  - Pre-built templates for faster integration  
  - Free, open-source blueprints adaptable to many industries  
  - Reduced complexity in multi-company collaboration  
  - Boosted innovation in Industry 4.0 (real-time monitoring, efficiency optimization, reduced downtime)  
- **How It Works:**  
  Each FAP defines **governance, identity management, credential handling, SLA monitoring, and orchestration flows**, ensuring that partners can connect their systems quickly and securely. Organizations retain **full control of their own data and services** while adhering to a **shared governance model**.
  
In essence, **FAPs are the building blocks of digital federation**, enabling independent organizations to collaborate while safeguarding sovereignty, compliance, and trust.

## About FAPs & FRAME  
FACIS leverages **Federation Architecture Patterns (FAPs)** as the **core blueprint** for interoperability in federated ecosystems.  
- **Feature-FAPs**: modular building blocks addressing major domains (e.g., Storage, Authentication).  
- **Micro-FAPs**: executable units handling small, focused tasks (e.g., install CAT service, validate credential).  
- **FRAME** (FAP Readiness & Architecture Model for Ecosystems) provides the **scalable backbone** of FAPs – ensuring they are modular, reusable, and compliant across diverse providers.  
- FAPs are aligned with open-source ecosystems such as **Gaia-X, XFSC, IDS, FIWARE, Tractus-X**, ensuring broad adoption and reusability.  

**Core Functions of FACIS & FRAME:**  
- Low-code orchestration with the **XFSC Orchestrator**  
- Establishment of an **OSS repository** for FAPs under Eclipse Foundation  
- Delivery of **executable FAPs as templates**  
- Provision of **demo environments** for validation and PoC

## FRAME Methodology & Lifecycle  
The **FRAME methodology** defines a systematic lifecycle for developing FAPs:  
1. **Use Case Identification** – Define the goals and challenges.  
2. **Stakeholder Engagement** – Collect requirements via workshops.  
3. **Scenario Specification** – Define Base FAPs and Vertical FAPs.  
4. **Low-Code Orchestration** – Develop executable templates with XFSC Orchestrator.  
5. **Integration with OSS** – Leverage Gaia-X, XFSC, IDS, Tractus-X, FIWARE.  
6. **Prototyping & Testing** – Build demo environments and validate functionality.  
7. **Quality Assurance** – Conduct compliance and interoperability validation.  
8. **Technical Provisioning** – Provide repositories, testbeds, registries.  
9. **Implementation & Integration** – Deploy FAPs into federated environments.  
10. **Dissemination & Community Building** – Publish results, workshops, open repos.  
11. **Final Validation & Approval** – Formal review and sign-off.  

This lifecycle ensures that each FAP is **standardized, tested, and reusable** across federated ecosystems.

## FACIS FAP1 Breakdown  
The first Federation Architecture Pattern (**FAP1**) is structured into **five Feature-FAPs**, each containing several Micro-FAPs that handle specific functions:  

1. **Storage**  
   - CAT (Catalog): Registers participants and services  
   - OCM (Organization Credential Manager): Stores and manages organizational credentials  
   - PCM Cloud (Personal Credential Manager): Handles personal user credentials  
   - Integration with ORCE for orchestration, scaling, and resource allocation  

2. **Onboarding Wizard**  
   - Multi-step user interface for onboarding new participants  
   - Wizard orchestration logic to guide flows  
   - Basic integration with authentication and backend services  

3. **Credential Management & Validation**  
   - Credential issuance based on onboarding/authentication data  
   - Validation engine (signature, JSON format, revocation list)  
   - Lifecycle management: renewals and revocations  

4. **Authentication**  
   - Supports OAuth2, SAML, and OIDC  
   - Role/Policy service (RBAC/ABAC)  
   - Session management and security hooks  

5. **GXDCH Connect**  
   - Integration with Gaia-X Digital Clearing House  
   - Credential issuance and validation against Gaia-X standards  
   - Auditing and notification for compliance events

## Example Use Cases (FAPs)  
Beyond FAP1, FACIS defines additional **base and vertical FAPs**:  
- **Partner Registration** (reference FAP for onboarding)  
- **Digital Contract Creation** (secure, compliant digital contracting)  
- **Validation of Distributed Information Objects** (e.g., Product Passport)  
- **AI Training Framework** (collaborative AI pipelines)  
- **Collaborative Condition Monitoring** (federated monitoring across providers)  

---

## Planned Deliverables (WP1)  
According to the WP1 FAP Plan:  
- **5 Base FAPs** (Partner Registration, Digital Contract Creation, Validation of Distributed Information Objects, AI Training Framework, Collaborative Condition Monitoring)  
- **3–5 Vertical FAPs (V-FAPs)** developed for domain-specific use cases  
- **OSS Repository for FAPs** hosted under Eclipse Foundation  
- **FAPs Testbed** for operational testing and validation  

---

## Roadmap (High-Level)  
The development of FAP1 follows a phased approach:  
- **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure and Storage services (CAT, OCM, PCM)  
- **Phase 2**: Authentication services  
- **Phase 3**: Onboarding Wizard front-end & orchestration  
- **Phase 4**: Credential Management & Validation flows  
- **Phase 5**: Full Gaia-X compliance via GXDCH Connect
